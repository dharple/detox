# Overview

`detox` is a program that renames files to make them easier to work with under
Unix and related operating systems.  Spaces and various other unsafe
characters (such as "$") get replaced with "_".  ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)
characters can be transliterated to ASCII, as can UTF-8 characters.
More details are contained in the `detox.1` [man page].

# Notice for Package Maintainers

Version 2 adds a new dependency for package builds: `pkg-config` or `pkgconf`.

You may also need to add a dependency on `libtool`.  Please let me know if you
do, by creating an [issue].  I'll update the docs accordingly.

Also, the default config file and translation tables are no longer prefixed
with `.sample`.

Please open an [issue] for any build problems encountered.  Thanks!

# Notice for Everyone

I have renamed the `master` branch to `main`.  If you have a copy of detox
checked out, you can update your code to point at the new branch using
[these steps].  Alternatively, you can clone a fresh copy of the repo.

# Runtime Notes

The most important option to learn is `-n`, aka `--dry-run`.  This will let you
run `detox` without actually changing any files, so that you can get an idea
of what `detox` is all about.

The simplest way to run `detox` is to just run it on a directory containing
files that need work:

```
detox xfer_files/
```

You can also just to specify the filename:

```
detox my\ bad\ file.txt
```

You can also specify recursion (this works best on directories):

```
detox -r /music/transferred_from_elsewhere/
```

# Building Detox

Many distributions include a copy of detox with their packages.  If you wish to
build it from scratch, you'll need the following tools:

- autoconf
- automake
- bison / yacc / byacc
- flex / lex
- gcc / clang
- make
- pkg-config / pkgconf

## Prerequisites

To install the needed packages on Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, and other Debian
derivatives, run:

```
sudo apt install autoconf automake bison flex gcc make pkg-config
```

To install the needed packages on macOS, run:
```
brew install autoconf automake bison flex gcc make pkg-config
```

On FreeBSD, run:
```
sudo pkg install autoconf automake gcc pkgconf wget
```

On NetBSD, run:
```
sudo pkgin install autoconf automake mozilla-rootcerts pkgconf wget
sudo mozilla-rootcerts install
```

On MSYS2, run:
```
pacman -S --needed base-devel gcc git mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
```

## Install Stable from GitHub Package

To build a stable copy of `detox`, run:

```
wget https://github.com/dharple/detox/releases/download/v1.4.5/detox-1.4.5.tar.gz
tar xzvf detox-1.4.5.tar.gz
cd detox-1.4.5
./configure
make
make install
```

If that fails during the configure or make steps, run:
```
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make install
```

## Install Stable from Repository

To build a stable copy of `detox` from source, install the package `git`, then
run:

```
git clone -b 1.x https://github.com/dharple/detox.git
cd detox
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make install
```

## Install Development from Repository

To build a development copy of `detox` from source, install the package `git`,
then run:

```
git clone -b main https://github.com/dharple/detox.git
cd detox
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make install
```

## Uninstall

To remove a copy of `detox` that was installed via these methods, from the same
directory that you ran `make install`, run:

```
make uninstall
```
